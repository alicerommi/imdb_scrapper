Here's a `README.md` file to guide users through setting up and running your Scrapy project with the provided Dockerfile:

# Scrapy Project with Docker

This project sets up a Scrapy spider to crawl and extract data, using Docker for containerization. The spider `imdb_top50` scrapes the top 50 movies from IMDb and outputs the data to a JSON file.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
   ```bash
   docker build -t scrapy-imdb .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**

   Run the Docker container to start the Scrapy spider:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output scrapy-imdb
   ```

   This command will:
   - Run the Scrapy spider `imdb_top50`.
   - Output the scraped data to `output/top50_movies.json`.

## Dockerfile Explanation

The Dockerfile sets up the environment for running the Scrapy spider:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies and Chrome
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget \
    unzip \
    gcc \
    libffi-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    gnupg \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python packages
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Command to run the Scrapy spider
CMD ["scrapy", "crawl", "imdb_top50", "-o", "output/top50_movies.json"]
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary Python packages for your Scrapy project.
- The `output` directory is mounted as a volume to persist the scraped data outside the Docker container.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:
- Ensure Docker is running and properly installed.
- Verify that the `requirements.txt` file is correctly formatted and includes all dependencies.
- Check the logs for any errors during the build or run process.
